# Fund Me project setup

## Foreword

Welcome the the second section of `Foundry Fundamentals`. Here we'll cover `Fund Me`, a simple funding contract.

You will learn:

- How to push your project to GitHub;
- Write and run amazing tests;
- Advanced deploy scripts, used to deploy on different chains that require different addresses;
- How to use scripts to interact with contracts, so we can easily reproduce our actions;
- How to use a price feed;
- How to use Chisel;
- Smart contract automation;
- How to make our contracts more gas efficient;
- And many more interesting things!

Until now, we talked a lot about storage and state, but we didn't delve into what they really mean. We will learn what all these means!

We used this project before when we used Remix.

### Fund Me

Going through the [repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-f23) we can see that our contract is in the `src` folder. Let's open `FundMe.sol`.

As you can see we are employing some advanced tools/standard naming conventions:

- We use a named error `FundMe__NotOwner();`;
- We use all caps for constants;
- `i_` for immutable variables;
- `s_` for private variables;

Let's clone this project locally. Open your VS Code, and make sure you are in the `foundry-f23` folder, if not use `cd` to navigate to it.

If we run the `ls` command in the terminal, we'll see that the only thing present in the `foundry-f23` folder is the `foundry-simple-storage-f23` folder that we used in the previous section.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir foundry-fund-me-f23
cd foundry-fund-me-f23

code .
```

The first line creates a new folder called `foundry-fund-me-f23`. The second line changed the directory into the newly created folder. The last line opens up a new VS Code instance using the newly created folder.

Now we can apply the knowledge we acquired in the previous section to create a fresh Foundry project.

**Do you remember how?**

If you do, please proceed in creating a Foundry project on your own. If not peek down below.

No worries, we all forget stuff, please run the following command:

```bash
forge init
```

or

```bash
forge init --force
```

Foundry will populate the project with the `Counter` files, the script, the main contract and the test.

Before deleting it, let's look a bit through these.
