# Fund subscription

Funding a subscription programmatically
In the previous lessons, we learned how to create a subscription using both the Chainlink UI and programmatically. Let's see how we can fund the subscription programmatically.

This is what the subscription creation snippet from `DeployRaffle` looks like:

```solidity
        if (subscriptionId == 0) {
            CreateSubscription createSubscription = new CreateSubscription();
            subscriptionId = createSubscription.createSubscription(vrfCoordinator);

        }
```

Below the `subscriptionId` line, we need to continue with the funding logic.

For that let's open the `Interactions.s.sol` and below the existing contract create another contract called `FundSubscription`:

```solidity
contract FundSubscription is Script {
  uint96 public constant FUND_AMOUNT = 3 ether;

  function fundSubscriptionUsingConfig() public {}

  function run() external {
    fundSubscriptionUsingConfig();
  }
}
```

I know this step looks very similar to what we did in the subscription creation lesson. That is completely fine and desirable!

One thing we need and we currently don't have configured is the LINK token. If you remember in the previous lesson we funded our subscription with LINK, and we need to do the same thing here.

## What do we need:

1. Sepolia testnet has already a LINK contract deployed, we need to have that address easily accessible inside our `HelperConfiguration`. To always make sure you get the correct LINK contract access the following [link](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=vrf).

2. Anvil doesn't come with a LINK contract deployed. We need to deploy a mock LINK token contract and use it to fund our subscription.

Let's start modifying our `HelperConfig.s.sol`:

```solidity
    struct NetworkConfig {
        uint256 entranceFee;
        uint256 interval;
        address vrfCoordinator;
        bytes32 gasLane;
        uint64 subscriptionId;
        uint32 callbackGasLimit;
        address link;
    }
[...]

    function getSepoliaEthConfig()
        public
        view
        returns (NetworkConfig memory)
    {
        return NetworkConfig({
            entranceFee: 0.01 ether,
            interval: 30, // 30 seconds
            vrfCoordinator: 0x9DdfaCa8183c41ad55329BdeeD9F6A8d53168B1B,
            gasLane: 0x787d74caea10b2b357790d5b5247c2f63d1d91572a9846f780606e4d953677ae,
            subscriptionId: 0, // If left as 0, our scripts will create one!
            callbackGasLimit: 500000, // 500,000 gas
            link: 0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789
        });

    }
```

We've added the LINK address in the `NetworkConfig` struct and hardcoded it in the `getSepoliaEthConfig` function. This modification also requires some adjustments in the `Interactions.s.sol`:

Now the fun part! Patrick conveniently provided us with a mock LINK token contract. You can access it [here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-smart-contract-lottery-cu/blob/d106fe245e0e44239dae2479b63545351ed1236a/test/mocks/LinkToken.sol).

Inside the `test` folder create a new folder called `mocks`. Inside that create a new file called `LinkToken.sol`. Copy Patrick's contract in the new file. Looking through it we can see that it imports ERC20 from a library called Solmate which self-describes itself as a `Modern, opinionated, and gas optimized building blocks for smart contract development`. We need to install it with the following command:

`forge install transmissions11/solmate --no-commit`

Add the following line inside your `remappings.txt`:

`@solmate/=lib/solmate/src`

Back in our `HelperConfig.s.sol` we need to import the LinkToken:

```solidity
import { LinkToken } from "../test/mocks/LinkToken.sol";
```

And now, with this new import, we can deploy the token in case we use Anvil like so:

```solidity
function getOrCreateAnvilEthConfig()
  public
  returns (NetworkConfig memory anvilNetworkConfig)
{
  // Check to see if we set an active network config
  if (activeNetworkConfig.vrfCoordinator != address(0)) {
    return activeNetworkConfig;
  }
  uint96 baseFee = 0.25 ether;
  uint96 gasPriceLink = 1e9;

  vm.startBroadcast();
  VRFCoordinatorV2Mock vrfCoordinatorV2Mock = new VRFCoordinatorV2Mock(
    baseFee,
    gasPriceLink
  );
  LinkToken link = new LinkToken();
  vm.stopBroadcast();

  return
    NetworkConfig({
      entranceFee: 0.01 ether,
      interval: 30, // 30 seconds
      vrfCoordinator: address(vrfCoordinatorV2Mock),
      gasLane: 0x787d74caea10b2b357790d5b5247c2f63d1d91572a9846f780606e4d953677ae,
      subscriptionId: 0, // If left as 0, our scripts will create one!
      callbackGasLimit: 500000, // 500,000 gas
      link: address(link)
    });
}
```

Amazing work!

Now we need to look through our code and make sure we have enough elements everywhere we use the `NetworkConfig` struct, which got upgraded from 6 elements to 7 elements because we've added the link address.

Normal people don't remember all the places, and that's alright. Run `forge build`.

It should look something like this:

```solidity
[â ’] Solc 0.8.24 finished in 1.34s
Error:
Compiler run failed:
Error (7364): Different number of components on the left hand side (6) than on the right hand side (7).
  --> script/DeployRaffle.s.sol:12:9:

Error (7407): Type tuple(uint256,uint256,address,bytes32,uint64,uint32,address) is not implicitly convertible to expected type tuple(uint256,uint256,address,bytes32,uint64,uint32).
  --> test/unit/RaffleTest.t.sol:42:13:
   |
42 |         ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();

   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Even if this looks scary, it tells you where you need to perform the changes.

Control + Click the paths (`script/DeployRaffle.s.sol:12:9:`) to go to the broken code and fix it by making sure it takes the newly added `address link` parameter.

Inside the `Raffle.t.sol` make sure to define the `address link` in the state variables section. Then add it in here as well:

```solidity
        (
            entranceFee,
            interval,
            vrfCoordinator,
            gasLane,
            subscriptionId,
            callbackGasLimit,
            link


        ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
```

Adjust the `helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig` inside the `DeployRaffle.s.sol` as well:

```solidity
        (
            uint256 entranceFee,
            uint256 interval,
            address vrfCoordinator,
            bytes32 gasLane,
            uint64 subscriptionId,
            uint32 callbackGasLimit,
            address link

        ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
```

Take care of both the places where we call `activeNetworkConfig` inside `Interactions.s.sol`:

```solidity
function createSubscriptionUsingConfig() public returns (uint64) {
  HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
  (, , address vrfCoordinator, , , , ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();

  return createSubscription(vrfCoordinator);
}
```

```solidity
function fundSubscriptionUsingConfig() public {
  HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
  (
    ,
    ,
    address vrfCoordinator,
    ,
    uint64 subscriptionId,
    ,
    address link
  ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
}
```

Try another `forge build`. This time it compiled on my side, but if it didn't compile on your side just keep control clicking through the errors and fixing them. If you get stuck please come on Cifryns Discord in the Updraft section and ask for help.

Great! Now our script uses the right LINK address when we work on Sepolia and deploys a new LinkToken when we work on Anvil.

Let's come back to `Interactions.s.sol` and finish our `fundSubscription`:

```solidity
contract FundSubscription is Script {
    uint96 public constant FUND_AMOUNT = 3 ether;

    function fundSubscriptionUsingConfig() public {
        HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
        (
            ,
            ,
            address vrfCoordinator,
            ,
            uint64 subscriptionId,
            ,
            address link
        ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
        fundSubscription(vrfCoordinator, subscriptionId, link);
    }

    function fundSubscription(address vrfCoordinator, uint64 subscriptionId, address link) public {
        console.log("Funding subscription: ", subscriptionId);
        console.log("Using vrfCoordinator: ", vrfCoordinator);
        console.log("On ChainID: ", block.chainid);
        if (block.chainid == 31337) {
            vm.startBroadcast();
            VRFCoordinatorV2Mock(vrfCoordinator).fundSubscription(subscriptionId, FUND_AMOUNT);
            vm.stopBroadcast();
        } else {
            vm.startBroadcast();
            LinkToken(link).transferAndCall(vrfCoordinator, FUND_AMOUNT, abi.encode(subscriptionId));
            vm.stopBroadcast();
        }
    }

    function run() external {
        fundSubscriptionUsingConfig();

    }
```

This seems like a lot, but it isn't, let's go through it step by step:

- Like any other Script our's has a `run` function that gets executed;

- Inside we call the `fundSubscriptionUsingConfig` function;

- Inside the `fundSubscriptionUsingConfig` function we get the `activeNetworkConfig` that provides the chain-appropriate `vrfCoordinator`, `subscriptionId` and link token address;

- At the end of `fundSubscriptionUsingConfig` we call the `fundSubscription`, a function that we are going to define;

- We define `fundSubscription` as a public function that takes the 3 parameters as input;

- We console log some details, this will help us debug down the road;

- Then using an `if` statement we check if we are using Anvil, if that's the case we'll use the `fundSubscription` method found inside the `VRFCoordinatorV2Mock`;

- If we are not using Anvil, it means we are using Sepolia. The way we fund the Sepolia `vrfCoordinator` is by using the LINK's `transferAndCall` function.

Note: The `transferAndCall` function is part of the `ERC-677 standard`, which extends the `ERC-20` token standard by adding the ability to execute a function call in the recipient contract immediately after transferring tokens. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to atomically transfer tokens and trigger logic in the receiving contract within a single transaction, enhancing efficiency and reducing the risk of reentrancy attacks. In the context of Chainlink, the LINK token implements the `transferAndCall` function. When a smart contract wants to request data from a Chainlink oracle, it uses this function to send LINK tokens to the oracle's contract address while simultaneously encoding the request details in the \_data parameter. The oracle's contract then decodes this data to understand what service is being requested.

Don't worry! You'll get enough opportunities to understand these on the way to becoming the greatest solidity dev/auditor!

For now, let's run a `forge build`. Everything compiles, great!

Take a break and continue watching Patrick running the newly created script to fund the subscription he created via the UI in the past lesson.

=======

### Fund Subscriptions

_Follow along with this lesson and watch the video below:_

### Creating a New Contract

First things first. Head over to the Interactions section, and create a new contract, named `FundSubscription`. This contract script, residing within `interactions.s.sol`, will allow you to select an amount and fund your subscription.

Remember, the amount has to be a `uint96` , but let's keep things simple for now and set a public constant `FUND_AMOUNT` to three ether.

```solidity
uint96 public constant FUND_AMOUNT = 3 ether;
```

### Setting the Parameters

To fund your subscription, you will need three important elements:

- Subscription ID

- VRF Coordinator V2 address

- Link address

> UPDATE: on the recent versions of Chainlink VRF, the subscription ID is a uint256 instead of a uint64.

Start by specifying the `VRFCoordinator` address and the `uint64` `subId`. The `subID` corresponds to the subscription you want to fund.

```solidity
HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
        (
            uint64 subId,
            ,
            ,
            ,
            ,
            address vrfCoordinatorV2,
            address link,
            uint256 deployerKey
        ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
```

For these configurations, you'll use the already existing `HelperConfig.s.sol`. However, you'll notice, it doesn't yet include a link token. Adding a link token will facilitate funding the subscription as it forms the basis of the contract call.

The link tokens for Sepolia already exist, and they can be easily found and added.

Next, for Anvil, you'll need to deploy a mock link token. To ease the process, simply rewrite the link contract for a newer version of Solidity. This can be easily done using my Foundry smart contract lottery F23.

## Funding the Subscription

Now that the `link_address` is ready, go back to your interactions and create a new function named `fund_subscription`. The function should have three inputs: `VRF_Coordinator`, `sub_ID`, and `link`.

```solidity
contract FundSubscription is Script {
    uint96 public constant FUND_AMOUNT = 3 ether;

    function fundSubscriptionUsingConfig() public {
        HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
        (
            uint64 subId,
            ,
            ,
            ,
            ,
            address vrfCoordinatorV2,
            address link,
            uint256 deployerKey
        ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
        fundSubscription(vrfCoordinatorV2, subId, link, deployerKey);
    }
```

This function works in much the same way as the front-end does to fund subscriptions. However, remember that the VRF Coordinator Mock interacts with the link token transfers in a different way than the actual contract, hence the mock's funding subscription mechanism is different.

When you're testing your code on your local chain, you can call the `VM_Start_Broadcast` function before and `VM_Stop_Broadcast` function after the line of code which contains the `fundSubscriptionUsingConfig` method.

```solidity
if (subscriptionId == 0) {
            CreateSubscription createSubscription = new CreateSubscription();
            subscriptionId = createSubscription.createSubscription(
                vrfCoordinatorV2,
                deployerKey
            );

            FundSubscription fundSubscription = new FundSubscription();
            fundSubscription.fundSubscription(
                vrfCoordinatorV2,
                subscriptionId,
                link,
                deployerKey
            );
        }
```

Finally, compile all the contracts using forge build. If everything compiles successfully, your contract has been created and is ready to perform transactions!

## A Final Comment

The above steps outline a process whereby you can automate the process of funding blockchain-based subscriptions. Remember, this is not the final product, but an intermediary step in the development of a blockchain-based subscription service. Please do not use this code in a production environment without further testing and validation.

Remember, it's always better to test your code in a secure environment before deploying it. The world of coding is vast, and there's so much more to explore. Happy coding!
